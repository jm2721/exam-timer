An exam timer with pause, stop, resume buttons. Is a work in progress. Will add more features as time goes on.
Written in C++ using gtkmm graphics library.

We added spinbuttons for the user to choose how much time. Start, stop, pause, resume buttons functional.
Timer operates by filling up three concentric circles, of which the outermost is seconds, middle is minutes
and innermost is hours. Seconds and minutes are divided into 60 units more or less, so each minute/second 
increases the circle by about 6 degrees. Hours are divided into 24 units. So every time an hour ends, circle
increases by about 15 degrees. When stopped, clock is not visible. In future, will likely add a message to
notify user that time has ended, instead of just having the clock disappear.
