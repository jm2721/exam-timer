Exam Timer built with gtkmm graphics library
Spinbuttons regulate how the user inputs the time. Timer operates by filling up three concentric circles, of which the outermost is seconds, middle is minutes
and innermost is hours. Seconds and minutes are divided into 60 units more or less, so each minute/second 
increases the circle by about 6 degrees. Hours are divided into 24 units. So every time an hour ends, circle
increases by about 15 degrees. A kind of obnoxious flashing TIME'S UP message appears when timer ends.
